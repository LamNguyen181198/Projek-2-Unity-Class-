# Projek-2-Unity-Class-
Old Project folder for an on class Unity game

Yup, it is exactly what it's sound like. This is a smol game developed by me throughout the process of learning "Intro to Unity" by Eric Palvone (awesome guy and currently the developer for Epic Tavern)

The game is a 3D coin collector (4 objects around the map that only has some basic textures).
Other than that, the game is about... 75% textured. The enemy and the player character model are downloadable from Mixamo, while the ground and skybox textures all come from the Unity Store. 

There will be no further updates to the game, but it is there as my starting accomplishment
